My first day, doing Introduction to JS
  I started today with Introduct to github
Learnt what github is - a verson control system used to collaborate and track code changes.
learnt about key git concepts
Repository: A folder where Git tracks your project and its history.
Clone: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
Commit: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
Branch: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
Push: Send your changes to a remote repository.

I also learnt about some git commands from the video in the resources, though i didnt master all commands,
i did understand the basic ones.
init to initialize, pull to save form remote to local , push to save from local to remote, commit to save 
a snapshot.

As part of my day 1, i also delved into understanding HTML basics.
HTML meaning hypertext markup language is the most common language usde to develop web pages.
I covered lesson on tags (headings, paragraphs, lists and links)
<head> Introductory content</head>
<h1> Most important heading </h1> <h6> least important heading </h6>
<p> paragraph </p> <ol> ordered list </ol> <ul> unordered list  </ul>
<a href="link goes here > Placeholder </a>
<b> bold text </b> <br> break
<ul> underline </ul>
<table> table </table> <tr> table row </tr>

I also got an understanding of the general structure of an html document, from the head which mostly contains
background information, main body for the main content to be displayed , then footer.

I equally took a look at semantic html (The meaningful tags) , tags that explain their meaning, 
this is crucial for maintainance, accessibility and search engine optimization.

some examples of semantic tags
<header> introductory content and navigation links
<nav> section for navigation links, found in the header tag
<main> main contemt of the document or web page
<section> related content of the same theme or ssubject, eg a chapter
<article> a self contained composition , eg a blog post
<footer> closing content.
